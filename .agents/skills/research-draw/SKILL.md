description: >-
  Two-stage workflow for publication-style scientific schematics: generate or
  use a raster reference with imagegen/PNG/JPG/WebP, then trace it into an
  editable diagrams.net/draw.io file using draw-science. Use for
  Nature-style scientific illustrations, graphical abstracts, model or mechanism
  schematics, biomedical workflows, AI architecture figures, and paper-style
  visual drafts that should become editable .drawio source. For complex
  recognizable elements, author or select dedicated SVG glyphs and compare
  rendered SVGs against reference crops before inserting them, instead of
  assembling those elements from draw.io primitives. Enforces a minimum
  three-round strict pixel-level export/compare/fix loop for close
  raster-to-draw.io tracing tasks. Use with imagegen, draw.io, diagrams.net,
  scientific illustration, graphical abstract, paper schematic, figure tracing,
  SVG glyph tracing, and drawio redraw requests.

# Research Draw

Create or use a high-quality scientific illustration reference first, then
redraw it as an editable draw.io diagram. The raster image is a composition and
geometry guide, not the final source of truth.

## Required Skill Sequence

1. Use `imagegen` for the reference-image stage only when no suitable raster
   reference already exists.
2. Use `draw-science` for the draw.io tracing stage.
3. During the draw.io stage, use `draw-science` for layout, XML,
   export, and QA, but override its primitive-glyph default for complex
   recognizable elements with this skill's SVG glyph workflow.
4. Do not embed the generated bitmap as the final diagram body unless the user
   explicitly asks for a raster-backed figure.

## Routing Protocol

1. Read `references/two-stage-workflow.md` before starting.
2. Read `references/imagegen-reference-stage.md` before generating the raster
   reference image.
3. If tracing an existing PNG/JPG/WebP, read
   `references/png-layout-extraction.md` before authoring or editing `.drawio`.
4. Read `references/drawio-tracing-stage.md` before authoring or editing
   `.drawio`.
5. If complex real-world elements are present, such as animals, organs,
   instruments, cells with detailed morphology, or domain icons, read
   `references/complex-asset-sourcing.md`. Complex elements must use the SVG
   glyph workflow there, not draw.io primitive assembly.
6. Before final delivery, read `references/consistency-loop.md` and run the
   loop. For GPT/imagegen/raster tracing where close imitation matters, this is
   a minimum three-round strict pixel-level export/compare/fix loop.
7. After the final strict pixel comparison, run the final text completeness
   audit in `references/consistency-loop.md` before claiming delivery.
8. For GPT/imagegen/raster tracing where close imitation matters, make the
   draw.io stage load `draw-science` strict visual comparison rules.
9. If formulas appear, make the draw.io stage load the math reference from
   `draw-science`.
10. If online SVG assets are needed during the draw.io stage, use the local
   `add-svg` skill and follow its source gate. If self-designed SVG glyphs are
   sufficient, author them directly under the complex asset workflow.

## Operating Rules

- Establish the scientific message before image generation.
- Keep the reference image label-light. Final labels, formulas, and captions
  should be rebuilt as editable draw.io text.
- Treat imagegen text as unreliable unless it is visually inspected and correct.
- Use imagegen to explore composition, visual hierarchy, spatial grouping,
  lighting-free style, and object silhouettes.
- When a PNG/JPG/WebP reference exists, trace geometry before redesigning:
  preserve relative object positions, sizes, gutters, and visual density unless
  the user asks for redesign.
- Use draw.io primitives for abstract structure: containers, network blocks,
  arrows, simple matrices, simple charts, and editable labels.
- Do not assemble complex recognizable objects from draw.io primitives by
  default. Animals, organs, detailed cells, instruments, anatomy, protein
  cartoons, and similarly silhouette-sensitive objects should become dedicated
  SVG glyphs.
- For every complex SVG glyph, render it at the target size and compare it
  against the corresponding reference crop before insertion. Iterate the SVG
  until the silhouette, scale, and color family are close enough, or record the
  remaining strict-comparison failure.
- Use draw.io primitives for a complex object only when the object is actually
  simple/abstract, no reference crop exists, or the user explicitly prioritizes
  full draw.io editability over visual fidelity.
- Preserve scientific correctness, but do not use editability, vectorization,
  formula rebuilding, or scientific-cleanup language to excuse avoidable visual
  mismatch. If strict comparison fails, keep editing or report the task as not
  yet passed.
- Run the consistency loop after tracing. Fix blocking geometry, semantic, and
  draw.io QA mismatches before delivery, or state the remaining mismatches.
- When the goal is close imitation of a GPT/imagegen reference, export the
  draw.io PNG and run quantitative comparison in at least three iterations. Use
  the worst mismatch tiles and diff overlays to drive each additional edit pass.
- After pixel comparison passes or stops, perform a text completeness audit:
  compare intended labels, legends, panel letters, formulas, axis text, and
  annotations against the draw.io text cells and exported preview. Fix missing,
  truncated, misspelled, duplicated, or pseudo-text remnants before delivery.
- Do not claim completion with wording such as "strict pixel comparison did not
  pass because this is an editable redraw" or "metrics are documented in trace
  notes." A failed strict comparison remains a failed QA gate unless the user
  explicitly accepts a different target.

## Output Contract

Deliver or prepare:

```text
reference image: path to generated raster concept
editable source: .drawio file
trace notes: mapping from reference regions to draw.io modules, including
  approximate reference coordinates for major regions
asset notes: searched/selected assets, license notes, and self-designed fallbacks
svg glyphs: paths to authored/selected SVGs for complex objects, with insertion
  bbox and data-URI encoding notes
glyph comparison: per-complex-element reference crop, rendered SVG PNG,
  metrics/diff paths, pass/fail, and remaining mismatches
consistency loop: at least three iteration records for close tracing, fixes
  made, remaining mismatches
strict comparison: per-iteration metrics, pass/fail, diff overlay paths, worst
  mismatch tiles, and final status as passed or not passed
text completeness audit: source/intended text inventory, draw.io text inventory,
  missing or changed labels/formulas, fixes made, final pass/fail
QA: draw.io validation result and remaining risks
```

If image generation is unavailable, skip the raster stage only after stating the
blocker, then proceed with `draw-science` directly.
