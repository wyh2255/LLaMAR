# Research Flowchart QA Contract

Use this before final delivery, export, or reviewer-facing revision.

## Logic QA

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Scientific message | One-sentence message exists and the diagram supports it |
| Node necessity | Every node carries unique procedural or scientific meaning |
| Edge meaning | Arrows indicate sequence, transformation, causality, filtering, or feedback clearly |
| Visual entities | Major scientific objects are represented by semantic glyphs when visual structure is useful |
| Branch logic | Decisions, exclusions, controls, and alternatives are visually distinct |
| Abbreviations | Abbreviations are defined once in labels, legend, or caption |
| Reviewer risk | The diagram does not overclaim causality or hide key controls |

## Visual QA

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Reading path | The eye can follow the diagram without backtracking |
| Alignment | Nodes and modules share clean x/y coordinates and consistent sizes |
| Arrow crossings | Crossings are absent or rare and justified |
| Connector occlusion | No connector crosses text, formula cells, node bodies, matrix tiles, module headers, panel labels, or legends |
| Text/glyph separation | Labels do not cover bars, bases, cells, matrix tiles, network nodes, or other glyph primitives |
| Connector simplicity | Direct or one-bend routes are used whenever they do not cross protected elements |
| Color semantics | Each color has stable meaning and remains readable in grayscale |
| Typography | Text is readable at final size and remains editable |
| Formula rendering | Formulas use draw.io mathematical typesetting delimiters and the graph model has `math="1"` |
| Density | No node contains manuscript-length prose |
| All-text avoidance | The figure is not merely a collection of text boxes when the science has visual entities |
| Glyph editability | Composite elements are made from editable draw.io primitives and can be selected/revised |
| SVG substitution | If an inserted SVG represents an entity, redundant self-drawn primitive glyphs for that same entity are removed unless explicitly justified |
| Glyph semantics | Chart-like glyphs encode actual metrics, comparisons, or data patterns rather than arbitrary decoration |
| Style restraint | No decorative shadows, glossy gradients, clip art, or unused icons |
| Compactness | Removed or replaced glyph regions are reclaimed; the canvas and modules do not retain obvious stale whitespace |

## Draw.io Integrity QA

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Source file | `.drawio` source is present when a diagram is created from scratch |
| XML validity | XML parses without errors |
| Connectors | Edges are attached to source and target cells |
| Routing | Explicit waypoints are used when edges need to pass around other elements |
| Bend count | Connectors have no redundant waypoints, avoid micro-jogs, and use the minimum practical bend count |
| Canvas | No important object is off-canvas or clipped |
| Grouping | Module containers do not trap unrelated elements |
| Exports | SVG/PDF/PNG exports open and match the source layout |
| Preview loop | Exported PNG/SVG previews have been inspected for nonblank rendering, visible SVG assets, label/glyph separation, and canvas/crop integrity |
| Strict reference comparison | For traced figures, exported PNG has been compared against the reference with quantitative metrics, diff overlays, and worst-tile mismatch review |

## Required Local QA for Generated Draw.io Files

When Python is available, run:

```bash
python skills/draw-science/scripts/qa_drawio.py path/to/figure.drawio
```

Treat any `ERROR` as blocking. Treat `WARN` as a reason to inspect and revise
the layout unless the warning is clearly explained by the intended design.

When diagrams.net/draw.io Desktop CLI is available, also run:

```bash
python skills/draw-science/scripts/export_drawio_preview.py path/to/figure.drawio --formats png svg
```

Inspect the exported PNG/SVG preview before delivery. Treat missing preview
files, blank PNGs, invisible SVG assets, clipped content, label overlap, or
unexpected raster/rendering failures as blocking for publication-style figures.

For traced GPT/imagegen/raster references, also run:

```bash
python skills/draw-science/scripts/compare_drawio_reference.py reference.png path/to/exports/figure.png --mode strict
```

Treat strict comparison failures as blocking unless each remaining mismatch is
resolved in a later edit pass. For close GPT/imagegen/raster tracing, run at
least three strict export/compare/fix iterations and require a final strict pass
before calling the artifact complete. Do not mark failed strict metrics as
acceptable merely because the redraw is editable, vectorized, or uses MathJax
formulas. Use `--mode exact` as an aspirational diagnostic when the user asks
for maximum visual imitation.

## Export Bundle

For publication-oriented work, deliver or prepare:

```text
editable source: figure.drawio
primary preview: figure.svg
optional print: figure.pdf
optional quick preview: figure.png
notes: scientific message, archetype, abbreviations, and reviewer-risk flags
```

If local export tooling is unavailable, still provide the `.drawio` source, but
state that preview-based consistency QA was not completed and explain the exact
missing install or configuration step.
